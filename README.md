# Meh-Tricks: Towards Reproducible Results in NLP

This repository is based on the [Rogue Scores: Reproducibility Guide](https://analyses.org/2023/rogue-scores/reproduce/). 

It primarily investigates the METEOR score, its implementations and use in scientific papers.
It also touches BLEU scores.

## Requirements
### Literature Reviews
You need to install the following python packages
```
pandas
re  
numpy  
requests
time
```
The dataset by Rohatgi et al. is available [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ACL-OCL/ACL-OCL-Corpus). The parquet file has to be in \data.

### Code Reviews

For code reviews and creation of the graphics, there is an docker image similar to the one provided for ROUGE.


## Training

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
python train.py --input-data <path_to_data> --alpha 10 --beta 20
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.

## Evaluation

To evaluate my model on ImageNet, run:

```eval
python eval.py --model-file mymodel.pth --benchmark imagenet
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to evaluate the trained models on benchmarks reported in the paper, give commands that produce the results (section below).

## Pre-trained Models

You can download pretrained models here:

- [My awesome model](https://drive.google.com/mymodel.pth) trained on ImageNet using parameters x,y,z. 

>ðŸ“‹  Give a link to where/how the pretrained models can be downloaded and how they were trained (if applicable).  Alternatively you can have an additional column in your results table with a link to the models.

## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :

### [Image Classification on ImageNet](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet)

| Model name         | Top 1 Accuracy  | Top 5 Accuracy |
| ------------------ |---------------- | -------------- |
| My awesome model   |     85%         |      95%       |

>ðŸ“‹  Include a table of results from your paper, and link back to the leaderboard for clarity and context. If your main result is a figure, include that figure and link to the command or notebook to reproduce it. 


## Contributing

>ðŸ“‹  Pick a licence and describe how to contribute to your code repository.
